# Team-Project
This is the coursework for the Team Project Module. The task was to create an Air Ticket Sales System that utilised a database.

This was my first ever attempt at a large scale project in Java and this was also my first try at making a standalone application that communicated with a Database.

Unfortunately, due to the pandemic I was the only coder left on the project as my other coder was affected due to the unforseen circumstances so if you see any coding sins, please forgive me. But altogether, I think the project turned out pretty well!

On reflection, if I were to do this project again:
I would try to make my code more compact: this would involve generalizing methods in different classes in order to make them reusable and call them in different classes. There are a few points where I found myself copy pasting the same methods and modifying them slightly, which is quite inefficient.

Instead of using JAVAFX, I would use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and MongoDB.

Finally, I would code some of the extra features that I intended to implement such as automatic backup. Unfortunately, the time constraints and unforseen circumstances led to me leaving those extra features out and just going for the main system.

## Running the Program:
In order to run the program, please import the global libraries for the latest version of MYSQL driver and JAVAFX into your IDE. Edit the DatabaseConnection class to your liking in terms of the name of the database, username and the password.

Manually insert the BackupOfDatabase.txt file into your database SQL client and push the data into the database.

The project should then run.

A list of logins for the system in Username | Password form are as follows...

* Root | Root
* Dennis | Gnasher
* Minnie | NotiGirl
* Penelope | PinkMobile
* Arthur | LiesaLot
* You can make your own logins as well as long as you login as Root (or any other account that has System Administrator privileges).
